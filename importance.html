    <p class="margin">A digital portfolio allows me to put all of my important experiences on a single site. That way, I can look back at all the projects I have done and maybe feel good about it. It could also be used to see how far I have improved. Lastly, this can be important for anyone looking for help or if I were to go look for a job. </p>
