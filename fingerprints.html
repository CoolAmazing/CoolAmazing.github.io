    <p class="margin">During the early days of the internet, HTTPS was expensive, so it wasn't very common to come across a website with one. However, when the Internet became more prevalent in doing integral tasks, HTTPS was a necesity. HTTPS makes sure that only the client and the server gets access to the data.
