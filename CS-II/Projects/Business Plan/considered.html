    <h1 style="color:White">Considered Proposals</h1>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-bowerman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2 style="color:White">Extracurricular Student Interaction App</h2></a>
    <p>Extracurricular Student Interaction App was the old idea of Even Bowerman before he joined us. It's a website where students can obtain information about school related activites. It would be a cool idea, but there are a lot of websites that are similar to what he proposed.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophia-tran/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2 style="color:White">Available Tables</h2></a>
    <p>This project is an app that books online reservations at resturants without the need to call the resturant. I considered this project because I too, dislike calling up resturants to make reservations. I did not join however, due to previous plans to work on another project.</p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vivek-maranganti/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2 style="color:White">Code Converter</h2></a>
    <p>This project is a code converter. It will take in code and convert it into other programming languages. This project seems very challenging and will require a lot of knowledge and research of numerous programming languages. I considered this one becuase of the challenging aspect.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zane-baland/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2 style="color:White">Pair Search Board</h2></a>
    <p>Making a brain game seems interesting enough. It's also challenging without being to much of a stretch. I assume it would be 2D, so it may be easier than making a 3D game.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kyle-hernandez/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2 style="color:White">Unity Game</h2></a>
    <p>I heard that Unity is a fun engine to learn, and many indie devs use it, but since the proposer didn't specify on what type of game he is planning to make, I wouldn't be joining it.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zachary-chandler/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2 style="color:White">Souls-like Game</h2></a>
    <p>I'm not very experience in video games, though I have watched gameplays. I think a game similar to Dark Souls would be fun to make, but depending on the size of the map, it would need lots of work.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/faraz-piracha/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2 style="color:White">Foob</h2></a>
    <p>I would like to join in on the project because I'm good friends with the person who proposed the idea, but he already has two other group members, so I don't think he would want an extra person.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2>ShelterSafe</h2></a>
    <p>The projects seems interesting because natural disasters were always fascinating to me. However, I already have plans to work on a game with someone else.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jacob-jershin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"><h2>3D Rendering System</h2></a>
    <p>I think this projects is quite ambitious, but it could definitely be done since the proposer knows his stuff. Sometimes, devices have trouble loading whenever playing a 3D game. However, I have other plans.</p>
    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/christopher-carter/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/considered.html"><h2>Roguelike Game</h2></a>
    <p>I have decided on this proposal because it would be challenging, but can be done within the reasonable time limit. I haven't played a roguelike game myself, but watched gameplay videos and it's quite action-packed, which I like. I still don't agree with adding a battlepass because making it singleplayer casual is better for games of this type.</p>
