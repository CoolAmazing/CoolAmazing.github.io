    <h1 style="color:White">Business Plan</h1>
    <h2 style="color:White">Identity</h2>
    <p>For my-[ ISP I will be making a rogue-like game. We wil be experimenting with engines such as Godot. The game will include ads and a battle pass in order to make revenue.</p>
    <h2 style="color:White">Problem</h2>
    <p>People have to much free time. They want to have something to play. Maybe the stuff they currently play aren't challenging enough.</p>
    <h2 style="color:White">Solution</h2>
    <p>We are going to make a fun game that is challenging enough.</p>
    <h2 style="color:White">Target Market</h2>
    <p>People who like to play games. Mostly teens and maybe young adults with too much time on their hands.</p>
    <h2 style="color:White">Competition</h2>
    <p>There are probably a lot of rogue-like games on Steam and other online gaming shops.</p>
    <h2 style="color:White">Revenue Streams</h2>
    <p>We can get revenue from the game via add revenue and maybe microtransactions.</p>
    <h2 style="color:White">Marketing Activites</h2>
    <p>Might use Google ads.</p>
    <h2 style="color:White">Expenses</h2>
    <p>Steam Fee</p>
    <h2 style="color:White">Team and Key Roles</h2>
