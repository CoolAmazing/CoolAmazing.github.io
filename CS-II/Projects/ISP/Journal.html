  <p><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
  <p>We started working on the game. The main menu has been implemented, along with the sprite for the playable character and a gnome character. There is also some dialogue with a BB character as a placeholder. There was something implemented to the repo to make Godot easier to work with.</p>
  <p><b>Scheduling Challenges</b></p>
  <p>Dividing up the work was the first interpersonal challange we faced. We first started working on the parts of the game we agreed upon in the issues section, and each worked independantly on each feature. As of now, only one person has been doing all the work.</p>
  <p><b>Interpersonal Challenges</b></p>
  <p>There was a lot of communication issues because we were not working on the project a lot outside of class. While we all had Discord, we didn't utilize it as much as we thought.</p>
  <h3>12-Jan-2023</h3>
  <p><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
  <p>Need to download Godot and test it out.</p>
  <p><b>Scheduling Challenges</b></p>
  <p>Balancing the project out with other classes.</p>
  <p><b>Interpersonal Challenges</b></p>
  <p>We came up with different tasks and determined who would be doing what.</p>
  <h3>6-Jan-2023</h3>
  <p><b>Technical Challenges</b></p>
  <p>Since starting the project we have only encoutnered a few technical challenges. Finding the right engine to create the game on was one of them. We ultimately decided on the Godot engine. Another challange was setting up github repositoriesso we could all work on the game.</p>
  <p><b>Scheduling Challenges</b></p>
  <p>My teammates don't really have that much time to work on the project due to part-time jobs. I do have quite some time to work on the project, but don't really know what to do yet.</p>
  <p><b>Interpersonal Challenges</b></p>
  <p>The only interpersonal challange we have faced was one of our team members switching classes before we started the project. We also are deciding on a way to communicate outside of school to work on our project. We are considering discord for the main method of communication.</p>
