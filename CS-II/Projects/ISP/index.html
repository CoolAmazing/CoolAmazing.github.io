  <h1>ISP Getting Started</h1>
  <br>
  <p>My team for this ISP includes me, Evan, and Chris. The ISP we will be working on is a video game. This will be a dungeon crawler type game, with the goal being to get as far as possible, or to reach an end boss. It would have a lot of enemies in an enclosed space. We are using the Godot engine to make our game, meaning we will have to learn the ins and outs of the engine, as well as some of its supported languages.
