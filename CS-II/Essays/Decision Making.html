      <h3 style="color: white;">Intro</h3>
      <p>Biases play a major role in shaping the decisions we do everyday. The ISP is one of the projects that can be affected by bias. With a huge commitment needed in order to do the ISP, there are many choices to make that affect the quality of the end product. Though biases may not seem like much due to simply being a habit, they can be a huge roadblock in the path for finishing the ISP. Therefore, it's important to know them and also how to avoid them.</p>
      <h3 style="color: white;">Habit Bias</h3>
      <p>Habit bias is what it sounds like, having a bias for something familiar (Arnot, 2001). Habit bias would likely show up a lot in this project because the ISP is about going out of bounds and doing a lot of stuff that the person has not done before. It's normal for people to feel discouraged when they are forced to do something they have never done before, but since it's a group project, we are all in this together.</p>
	<h3 style="color:white;">Complexity Bias</h3>
      <p>The set of tasks may seemingly be overwhelming to think about. The ISP will be due in just a few months, and you don't know where to start. That is known as complexity bias (Arnot, 2001). Cognative bias can be avoided with a schedule. The ISP can be divided up into a set of tasks to complete by a certain deadline. This set of tasks must have a deadline that only slightly overlaps with another task just so it doesn't feel like we are doing everything at the same time. That way, it feels less overwhelming. </p>
      <h3 style="color: white;">Escalation Bias</h3>
      <p>Escalation bias is when someone commits to a certain path simply because they put a lot of effort on it. Of course, that could happen a lot on the projects with a lot of fixing bugs and development plans. With that in mind, it should be useful to listen to other people input while using a few elements from the failed solution that were stil somewhat successful. That would mean lots of time saved (Perry, n.d.).</p>
      <h3 style="color: white;">Anchoring</h3>
      <p>Anchoring bias involves a point of reference. In a way, it's quite similar to escalation bias. When one random number is randomly presented while the person is being asked with an unrelated question that involves a numeric value as an answer, they usually pick a number close to what was presented to them (Arnot, 2001). One solution is to be more aware about the number being presented to them and ask to themselves whether it even relates to the question.</p>
      <h3>Rate Bias</h3>
      <p>With rate bias, people usually use certain statistics that best align with their thoughts, unaware about the other factors involved (Arnot, 2001). This would mean believing in certain sediments only supported by rare events that can turn the statistics. Just like anchoring, it can be solved by thinking about it logically beforehand on whether it makes sense. It's useful to look at more statistics regarding the subject in order to understand it fully.</p>
      <h3 style="color: white;">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Biases can be hard to avoid due to people not being aware that they are even biased. There are also a ton of biases that can be applyed to just about anything. Therefore, it's important to think about everything beforehand before making decisions.</p>
