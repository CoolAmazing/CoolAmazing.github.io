      <h3 style="color:White">Intro</h3>
      <p>With rapid advances in AI, debates about the questions and ethics that surround it are frequent. One issue that is commonly brought up is the idea of AI becoming sentient. While AI advancing can be a good thing, there should be considerations about its consequences.</p>
      <h3 style="color:White">Advancing AI</h3>
      <p>Although AI sentience would be concerning, there is a lot of debate about what counts as AI having sentience and whether it can be sentient at all. This was put on the spotlight when Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, "concluded the technology was sentient" (Metz, 2022). This resulted in him getting fired. While it doesn't seem like much, it does bring up the question about how an AI wants to be treated if it really became sentient. Would sentient AI and humans work together to advance civilization or would they start an uprising after gaining individuality? These are some questions to consider. Even if AI may not achieve level of sentience anywhere near a human, there are various other concerns. Rapidly advancing AI can quickly replace jobs by simply being "faster, accurate, and consistant" (Talwar, 2022). There is also the issue about how people would use it. AI could have to potential to be used in many different application that would be alarming. Advanced AI could be used to mimic online interactions with people and even "churn out targeted misinformation on a vast scale" (Roose, 2022).</p>
      <h3 style="color:White">Sentient AI</h3>
      <p>If sentient AI were to emerge, it would most likely bring more controversy than gain. Since the AI would be able to think or itself, it would want to be treated like a person. This could lead the an intresting case of AI rebelling against humanity. Another concern is that if sentient AI really was made, "the humans who profit from it will rush to convince consumers that such a thing is impossible, that there is no reason to change the way they live" (Rini, 2022).</p>
      <h3 style="color:White">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>While AI can be beneficial for people all around the world, there should be some regulations just to make sure it doesn't get out of control whether it's people using AI for shady purposes or AI actually becoming sentient.</p>
